# BandhuConnect+ Web

## Project Status (September 2025)

This is the official website for BandhuConnect+, built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

### Key Features

- **High Contrast Accessibility:** Fully accessible with a high contrast mode toggle for visually impaired users. All UI elements, images, and icons adapt for clarity and usability.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Supports 10+ Indian languages. All major sections, including hero, features, and Why BandhuConnect+, are fully translatable.
- **Feature Cards:** Showcases app features with modern, accessible cards and images.
- **Download Section:** Download buttons for Android and iOS (app build in progress). Includes a QR code for donations/support.
- **Donation QR Code:** Prominently displayed in the download section for community support.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first, works across all devices.


### Current Limitations

- **App Not Yet Available:** The app is still in development. Download links are placeholders; a message is shown to users.
- **Some Features Marked 'Coming Soon':** Certain features are planned but not yet implemented in the app.
- **Demo Images:** Some feature images are placeholders until final assets are provided.

### How to Contribute

- Update translation files in `src/locales/` for new languages or improved text.

- See `TRANSLATION_QA.md` for translation coverage and QA process.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
